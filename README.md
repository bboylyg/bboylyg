### Hi there, I am Yige Li 👋

I am a research fellow at the School of Computing and Information Systems at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/) supervised by Prof. [Jun Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DVsEyn0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I also work closely with Prof. [Xingjun Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XQViiyYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at Fudan University. I completed my Ph.D. at [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Xixiang Lyu](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/xxlv/).  Research publications: [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h0cS2nQAAAAJ&hl=zh-EN)

I pursue research in **Trustworthy AI**, aiming to build secure, robust, and interpretable systems that align with human values and cognition.  I’m especially interested in **generative models** (LLMs, diffusion models, and AI agents) and **AI safety**, and I seek simple yet insightful solutions grounded in theory. Guided by the philosophy *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler,"* I approach research with both rigor and curiosity. Outside of work, I enjoy **rock climbing** 🧗 and **swimming** 🏊.


### 🔭 My research mainly focus on:

- AI Safety on LLMs and VLMs
- Backdoor attacks and jailbreak attacks on LLMs and VLMs
- Design and implement a general defense framework for backdoor attacks


### ⚡ Award Honors:

We're honored to share that our *BackdoorLLM* benchmark has won the **First Prize** in the [SafetyBench competition](https://www.mlsafety.org/safebench/winners), organized by the [Center for AI Safety](https://safe.ai/). Huge thanks to the organizers and reviewers for recognizing our work.
